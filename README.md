### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Thiago, a Physics Grad turned Data Scientist with a passion for UI Design, currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. I work as a Data Scientist at ItaÃº Unibanco. Since 2018, I've been involved in projects spanning the entire credit cycle, from application to collection. Currently, I'm working behind the scenes in banking, applying artificial intelligence to operational infrastructure.
